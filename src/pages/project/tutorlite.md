Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many students have been struggling in school, which has inspired us to become tutors ourselves in order to help those in need. We wanted to create a platform where tutors and students can meet each other and more easily fulfill each other's goals.

TutorLite is a web application that allows tutors and students to book appointments with google meet/zoom link integration, add multiple tutors and students to a single appointment, and message users within the app.

We built it using React, Redux, Typescript, and Firebase. React and Typescript is for the front end UI. Redux is for the global state. Firebase is for the NoSQL database.

We learned how to use React Typescript with Firebase firestore. We also learned more about how important it is to manage your time in a project.

We plan on implementing SMS notifications and reminders when a user books an appointment. We also want to clean up the UI and add geolocation based tutoring services.
