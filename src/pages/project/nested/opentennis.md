OpenTennis is a tennis team management platform that helps connect coaches and players together. It manages communication between coaches and players through its SMS and email services, tracks matchplay between players and tournaments, organizes team rosters/ladders based on varisty, junior varsity, or preseason groups, allows coaches to send out polls to players, and comes with a personal calendar to keep track of important events and activities.

Currently, the Amador Valley High School tennis team has been using my solution for the past year under Coach Mark and Coach Raj. The program has worked without flaw and is also currently being expanded to other high schools in the area.
